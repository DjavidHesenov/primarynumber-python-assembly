Step 1: Install NASM and GoLink
NASM: Download and install NASM from https://www.nasm.us/. During installation, make sure to add NASM to your system's PATH.
GoLink: Download GoLink from http://godevtool.com/. It's a free linker that works well with NASM on Windows. Extract it to a known directory and add this directory to your system's PATH.
Step 2: Write the Assembly Code
Create a new file named MessageBoxExample.asm and paste the following code:

asm
Copy code
; MessageBoxExample.asm
; Assemble with: nasm -f win32 MessageBoxExample.asm -o MessageBoxExample.obj
; Link with: golink /entry:start MessageBoxExample.obj user32.dll

global start

extern MessageBoxA
extern ExitProcess

section .data
    title   db 'Title', 0
    message db 'Hello, Windows Assembly!', 0

section .text
start:
    push    0               ; MB_OK
    push    title           ; Title of the message box
    push    message         ; Message to display
    push    0               ; Handle to the owner window
    call    MessageBoxA

    push    0               ; Exit code
    call    ExitProcess
This program uses the MessageBoxA function from the user32.dll library to display a message box.

Step 3: Assemble the Code
Open the Command Prompt, navigate to the directory where your .asm file is located, and assemble the program using NASM:

cmd
Copy code
nasm -f win32 MessageBoxExample.asm -o MessageBoxExample.obj
This will create an object file named MessageBoxExample.obj.

Step 4: Link the Object File
Now, link the object file to create an executable. In the Command Prompt, use GoLink:

cmd
Copy code
golink /entry:start MessageBoxExample.obj user32.dll kernel32.dll

This creates an executable file named MessageBoxExample.exe.

Step 5: Run the Executable
Run the program by either double-clicking the MessageBoxExample.exe file in your file explorer or by executing it in the Command Prompt:

cmd
Copy code
MessageBoxExample.exe
This will display a message box with the text "Hello, Windows Assembly!" and the title "Title".

Notes
Ensure NASM and GoLink are correctly installed and their paths are added to the PATH environment variable.
The assembly code provided is for 32-bit Windows. If you are on a 64-bit system, the code and the assembly/linking process will be slightly different.
This example demonstrates a basic use of Windows API in assembly language. Windows API functions often require a specific calling convention and parameters, so understanding these aspects is crucial for more complex programs.
